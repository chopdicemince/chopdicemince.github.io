# What is Scheme?

[An old web page for Scheme (last changed 2003-10-23)](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/projects/scheme/) says:

> Scheme is a statically scoped and properly tail-recursive dialect of the Lisp programming language invented by Guy Lewis Steele Jr. and Gerald Jay Sussman. It was designed to have an exceptionally clear and simple semantics and few different ways to form expressions.

[Scheme is also called MIT/GNU Scheme.](https://www.gnu.org/software/mit-scheme/)

[Chis Hanson is the maintainer for Scheme.](https://sites.google.com/a/chris-hanson.org/cph/)
