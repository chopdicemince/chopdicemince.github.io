# What is CoffeeScript? Who is  Jeremy Ashkenas?

"CoffeeScript" is a pun on "JavaScript." [CoffeeScript](https://coffeescript.org/) is a programming language that was created in or before 2009 by Jeremy Ashkenas. The home page describes CoffeeScript as:

> The golden rule of CoffeeScript is: “It’s just JavaScript.” The code compiles one-to-one into the equivalent JS, and there is no interpretation at runtime. You can use any existing JavaScript library seamlessly from CoffeeScript (and vice-versa). The compiled output is readable, pretty-printed, and tends to run as fast or faster than the equivalent handwritten JavaScript.
