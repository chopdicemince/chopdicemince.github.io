# What is Elm? Who is Evan Czaplicki?

[Elm](http://elm-lang.org/) is a programming language created in 2012 by Evan Czaplicki.

Elm is a functional langauge that compiles to Javascript. Elm has types.

[Elm is a project on GitHub](https://github.com/elm/elm-lang.org)

[Czaplicki explained the reason for the name "Elm"](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/elm-discuss/S4zbHJWPXvU/JyavEHDDQucJ):

> I wanted to name it after a tree (nice names, not too much namespace pollution). I made a big list of pleasing tree names and noticed that Elm sounded quite like Element. That's pretty much it :)
