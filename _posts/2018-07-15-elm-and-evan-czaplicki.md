# What is Elm? Who is Evan Czaplicki?

[Elm](http://elm-lang.org/) is a programming language created in 2012 by Evan Czaplicki.

Elm is a functional langauge that compiles to Javascript. Elm has types.

[Elm is a project on GitHub](https://github.com/elm/elm-lang.org).

On 2013-06-13, [Czaplicki explained the reason for the name "Elm"](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/elm-discuss/S4zbHJWPXvU/JyavEHDDQucJ):

> I wanted to name it after a tree (nice names, not too much namespace pollution). I made a big list of pleasing tree names and noticed that Elm sounded quite like Element. That's pretty much it :)

Czaplicki has a thesis about Elm: [Elm\: Concurrent FRP for Functional GUIs] (https://www.seas.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/files/archived/Czaplicki.pdf), where "FRP" stands for "functional reactive programming," and "GUI" stands for "graphical user interface."

In 2012, [a Redditor named "wheatBread" announced that he had turned in the above thesis](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/rkyoa/my_thesis_is_finally_complete_elm_concurrent_frp/). Very likely, the Redditor was Czaplicki.
