# What is a "distribution"?

A "distribution," sometimes called just "distro," is a GNU/Linux operating system, with various additional programs, like word processors, web browsers, ...

[Distrowatch](https://distrowatch.com/) has a list of the one hundred most-popular distributions, according to web page hits per day on Distrowatch.

# Why could a GNU/Linux distribution not be totally free software?

[Free software is software that respects the freedom of users.](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) Free software can be zero-cost, but it does not have to be zero-cost.

A GNU/Linux distribution is a large collection of code. It is possible that a coder added non-free software, possibly because the coder thought that the non-free software would be convenient for users.
