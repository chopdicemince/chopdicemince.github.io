# Who is Guido van Rossum?

[Guido van Rossum](https://gvanrossum.github.io) is creator of Python. He is from the Netherlands.

Trivia: He used to live in Virginia and had a vanity license plate that said "PYTHON."

# When was Python created?

Van Rossum created Python in 1989, when he had a lot of time around Christmas. He wanted Python to be a better version of the language ABC, which he was using at work. The language Modula-3 was a source/model for parts of Python. In 1991, Van Rossum wrote about Python on USENET.

See [Why was Python created in the first place?](https://docs.python.org/3/faq/general.html#id7).
