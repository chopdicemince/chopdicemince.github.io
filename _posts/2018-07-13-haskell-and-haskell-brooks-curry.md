# What is Haskell?

Haskell is a programming language created in 1990. Haskell was not created by one person, but by committee.

For an autobiographical history from some of the creators of Haskell, see [A History of Haskell:
Being Lazy With Class](http://haskell.cs.yale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/history.pdf).

Some characteristics of Haskell are:

* Haskell is a functional programming language. In other words, a function is a value like any other, like an integer. One of the goals for creating Haskell was to merge a number of then-existing functional programming languages.

* Haskell is lazy, also called "non-strict" or "call-by-need." (The opposites are "strict" or "call-by-value.") A programming language is lazy if it delays evaluating an expression for as long as possible.

* Haskell is pure. A programming language is pure if calling a function has no side effects. In other words, calling the function will not read or write any variables, and will have no input or output.

* Haskell has type classes.

# Who is Haskell Brooks Curry?

[Haskell Brooks Curry](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Haskell-Brooks-Curry) (1900---1982) was a United States mathematician in logic. The Haskell programming language is named after him.

Ironically, Virginia Curry, his widow, said, “You know, Haskell actually never liked the name 'Haskell.'” She told this to people who asked for her permission to use "Haskell" as the name of the programming language.
