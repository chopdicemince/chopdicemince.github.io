# What is the rule of 72? What is the rule of 115?

The rule of 72 is a simple rule (also called a "rule of thumb" or "heuristic") that you can use to solve the following problem: If your money grows at a fixed rate each year, then how many years will it take for your money to double?

> Rule of 72: If your money grows at r% each year, then your money will double in about 72/r years.

The rule of 115 is simlar to the rule of 72, except that the rule of 115 gives the number of years that it will take for your money to triple:

> Rule of 115: If your money grows at r% each year, then your money will triple in about 115/r years.

# What is the exact number of years that it will take for my money to double? Or to triple?

Let P be your amount of money. P stands for "principal." Assume that P is a positive number.

Let r/100 be the rate at which your money grows each year. Assume that r is a positive number.

After 1 year, your money will grow to P(1 + r/100).

After 2 years, your money will grow to P(1 + r/100)^2.

After 3 years, your money will grow to P(1 + r/100)^3.

After n years, your money will grow to P(1 + r/100)^n.

If you want your money to double, then you want to solve for n in the equation: P(1 + r/100)^n = 2P. The solution is n = log(2) / log(1 + r/100), where "log" means "log base e," or "log base 10," or "log base any positive number not equal to 1."

If you want your money to triple, then similar calculations show that n = log(3) / log(1 + r/100).

# How accurate is the rule of 72? Or the rule of 115?

Below, we compare the rule of 72 with the exact time that it takes your money to double. However, we round to one decimal point.

Also below, we copmare the rule of 115 with the exact time that it take your money to triple.

# How did people discover the rule of 72? Or the rule of 115?

Probably people discovered the rule of 72 (and the rule of 115) by doing the following steps in a [spreadsheet](https://github.com/chopdicemince/chopdicemince.github.io/blob/master/download/rule-of-72-and-rule-of-115.ods?raw=true). 

* The rows have year n, where n is 0, 1, 2, 3, ...

* The columns have rate r%, where r is 1, 2, 3, ...

* For a fixed rate r%, what value of n makes the money double (or triple)?

* Probably people noticed that when the money doubles, then rn is about 72. When the money triples, then rn is about 115.
