# What is the Free Software Foundation?

The [Free Software Foundation](https://www.fsf.org/) (FSF) is a nonprofit orgnization which advocates [free software](https://www.fsf.org/about/what-is-free-software), which, simply, is software which respects the freedom of its users. Free software is usually zero-cost, but it does not have to be zero-cost.

The FSF was started in 1985 by Richard M. Stallman. In 1983, Stallman started a project called GNU ("GNU's Not Unix"), to write an operating system that was free software and similar to Unix.

The FSF uses only free software.
