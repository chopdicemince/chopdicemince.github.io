# What is Kotlin?

[Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) is a programming language created in 2010 by [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/), a company that creates integrated programing environments and other programming tools.

The [FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) for Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/faq.html) describe Kotlin as:

> What advantages does Kotlin give me over the Java programming language?
?>
> Kotlin is more concise. Rough estimates indicate approximately a 40% cut in the number of lines of code. It’s also more type-safe, e.g. support for non-nullable types makes applications less prone to NPE’s [null pointer exceptions]. Other features including smart casting, higher-order functions, extension functions and lambdas with receivers provide the ability to write expressive code as well as facilitating creation of DSL [domain-specific languages].
>
> Is Kotlin compatible with the Java programming language?

> Yes. Kotlin is 100% interoperable with the Java programming language...
>
> What can I use Kotlin for?
