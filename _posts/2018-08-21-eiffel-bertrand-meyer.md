# What is Eiffel? Who is Bertrand Meyer?

[Eiffel](https://www.eiffel.org) is an object-oriented programming language.

[ECMA (the European Computer Manufacturers Assocation) defines a standard for Eiffel.](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/ECMA-367.pdf) ECMA describes Eiffel as follows:

> Eiffel was originally designed, as a method of software construction and a notation to support that method, in 1985. The first implementation, from Eiffel Software (then Interactive Software Engineering Inc.), was commercially released in 1986. The principal designer of the first versions of the language was Bertrand Meyer.

The FAQs (frequently asked questions) for Eiffel say:

> Eiffel is named after Gustave Eiffel, an engineer who created the famous tower. The Eiffel Tower, built in 1887 for the 1889 World Fair, was completed on time and within budget, as will software projects written in Eiffel.

The FAQs also say that Betrand Meyer founded the company [Eiffel Software](https://www.eiffel.com/).

# What is "Design by Contract"?

"[Design by Contract](https://www.eiffel.com/values/design-by-contract/)" is a trademark. It is an analogy used by Eiffel. If one piece of code uses another piece of code, then we can think of this situation as a client using a supplier. The client and seller use a contract. The following text is from [The Power of Design by Contractâ„¢](https://www.eiffel.com/values/design-by-contract/):

>    The supplier must provide a certain result (obligation) and is entitled to expect that the client has satisfied the requisite conditions (benefit).
>
>    The client must satisfy these conditions (obligation) and is entitled to get the result (benefit).
>
>    Both parties must satisfy certain general laws and regulations, applying to all contracts.
