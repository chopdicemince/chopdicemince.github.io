# What is Erlang? Who is Joe Armstrong?

[Erlang](https://www.erlang.org/) is a programming language created in 1986 by Joe Armstrong, at the Ericsson Computer Science Laboratory. See [Inside Erlang – creator Joe Armstrong tells his story](https://www.erlang.org/about). The Erlang home page says:

> Erlang is a programming language used to build massively scalable soft real-time systems with requirements on high availability. Some of its uses are in telecoms, banking, e-commerce, computer telephony and instant messaging. Erlang's runtime system has built-in support for concurrency, distribution and fault tolerance.

# Who uses Erlang?

Around 2014-10-06, Facebook bought WhatsApp, a messaging app, for 19 billion dollars. Ten programmers used Erlang to write WhatsApp. See [Facebook Closes $19 Billion WhatsApp Deal](https://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2014/10/06/facebook-closes-19-billion-whatsapp-deal/#6038ac1d5c66).

[Joe Armstrong, who created Erlang at Ericsson, says that at Ericsson, many LTE and 3G phones are programmed in Erlang.](https://www.erlang.org/about)

Apache [CouchDB](https://couchdb.apache.org/) is a database that is programmed in Erlang. [CERN](https://home.cern/) (Conseil Européen pour la Recherche Nucléaire, European Counsel for the Nuclear Research) used CouchDB to discover the Higgs boson.
