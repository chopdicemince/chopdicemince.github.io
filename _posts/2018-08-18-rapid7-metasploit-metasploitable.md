# What is Rapid7?

[Rapid7](https://www.rapid7.com/) is a company whose global headquarters is in Boston, Massachusetts. Their website says:

> Rapid7’s mission is to lead the emerging SecOps [security operations] movement with our multi-product analytics and automation cloud and expertise.
>
> So, how did we get our name?
>
> When the Company first launched, it was based in Midtown, New York. Our founders, Alan, Tas, and Chad, traveled daily into the city on New York’s Rapid Transit system’s "Rapid7" train (you might notice our logo looks a bit like a bullet-train). With much of the planning and development for the Company discussed on that commute, it seemed only right to name the Company Rapid7.
