# What is Vue? Who is Yuxi ("Evan") You?

[Vue (Vue.js)](https://vuejs.org/) (pronounced "view") is a Javascript framework created in 2013 by [Yuxi ("Evan") You](https://twitter.com/youyuxi).

Evan You is a native of China. His hometown is Wuxi, which is near Shanghai. He came to the U.S for college.

[Vue is a project on GitHub](https://github.com/vuejs/vue).

# How did Vue start?

Evan You worked at Google Creative Lab. He spoke about how Angular motivated Vue:

> I figured, what if I could just extract the part that I really liked about Angular and build something really lightweight without all the extra concepts involved? I was also curious as to how its internal implementation worked. I started this experiment just trying to replicate this minimal feature set, like declarative data binding. That was basically how Vue started.
