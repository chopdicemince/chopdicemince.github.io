# What is WebAssembly?

[WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/), abbreviated as "Wasm," is a programming language for web browsers. 

[Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/), creator of the web broser Firefox, wrote a web page called [WebAssembly Concepts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Concepts). This web page describes WebAssembly as:

> It [WebAssembly] is not primarily intended to be written by hand, rather it is designed to be an effective compilation target for low-level source languages like C, C++, Rust, etc.
>
> WebAssembly is a different language from JavaScript, but it is not intended as a replacement. Instead, it is designed to complement and work alongside JavaScript...
>
> WebAssembly is a low-level assembly-like language with a compact binary format that runs with near-native performance...
