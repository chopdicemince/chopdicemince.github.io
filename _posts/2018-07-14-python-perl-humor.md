# What is the Python module "antigravity"?

Open Python and type:

```python
import antigravity
```

If you have network access, a brower window will open and go to the well-known comic strip [XKCD](https://xkcd.com/), by Randall Munroe, whose topics inlcude math, science, and programming. The web page will be a particular [comic strip about how Python is better than Perl](https://xkcd.com/353/). 

If you stop your mouse pointer over the strip for a few seconds, a tooltip will appear:

```
Tooltip: I wrote 20 short programs in Python yesterday. It was wonderful. Perl, I'm leaving you.
```

The text of the comic strip is below:

```
Person A: You're flying! How?
Person B: Python!
Person B: I learned it last night! Everything is so simple! Hellow world is just: print "Hello, world!"
Person A: I dunno...dynamic typing? Whitespace?
Person B: Come join us! Programming is fun again! It's a whole new world up here!
Person A: But how are you flying?
Person B: I just typed "import antigravity". [Note: Possibly this comment is saying that Python has many useful modules/libraries.]
Person A: That's it?
Person B: ...I also sampled everything in in the medicine cabinet for comparison. But I think this is the Python.
```

The joke is that Python makes things so easy---if you want to fly, just type "import antigravity".

# Another humorous copmarison between Python and Perl

In 1999, a person named "larry" thought that Python was better than Perl, and expressed this opinion by adaptating text from "Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back". See [Python Humor](https://www.python.org/doc/humor/).

```
EXTERIOR: DAGOBAH -- DAY
           With Yoda strapped to his back, Luke climbs up one of
        the many thick vines that grow in the swamp until he
        reaches the Dagobah statistics lab. Panting heavily, he
        continues his exercises -- grepping, installing new
        packages, logging in as root, and writing replacements for
        two-year-old shell scripts in Python.

YODA: Code!  Yes.  A programmer's strength flows from code
      maintainability.  But beware of Perl.  Terse syntax... more
      than one way to do it...  default variables.  The dark side
      of code maintainability are they.  Easily they flow, quick
      to join you when code you write.  If once you start down the
      dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny, consume
      you it will.

LUKE: Is Perl better than Python?

YODA: No... no... no.  Quicker, easier, more seductive.

LUKE: But how will I know why Python is better than Perl?

YODA: You will know.  When your code you try to read six months
      from now.
 ```
