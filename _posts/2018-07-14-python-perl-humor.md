# What is the Python module "antigravity"?

Open Python and type:

```python
import antigravity
```

If you have network access, a brower window will open and go to the well-known comic strip [XKCD](https://xkcd.com/), by Randall Munroe, whose topics inlcude math, science, and programming. The web page will be a particular [comic strip about how Python is better than Perl](https://xkcd.com/353/). 

If you stop your mouse pointer over the strip for a few seconds, a tooltip will appear:

```
Tooltip: I wrote 20 short programs in Python yesterday. It was wonderful. Perl, I'm leaving you.
```

The text of the comic strip is below:

```
Person A: You're flying! How?
Person B: Python!
Person B: I learned it last night! Everything is so simple! Hellow world is just: print "Hello, world!"
Person A: I dunno...dynamic typing? Whitespace?
Person B: Come join us! Programming is fun again! It's a whole new world up here!
Person A: But how are you flying?
Person B: I just typed "import antigravity". [Note: Possibly this comment is saying that Python has many useful modules/libraries.]
Person A: That's it?
Person B: ...I also sampled everything in in the medicine cabinet for comparison. But I think this is the Python.
```

The joke is that Python makes things so easy---if you want to fly, just type "import antigravity".
