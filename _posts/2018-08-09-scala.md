# What is Scala?

[Scala](https://scala-lang.org/) is a programming language created in 2001 by Martin Odersky and his research group at EPFL (École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne, Federal Polytechnic School of Lausanne), in Lausanne, Switzerland.

The [Scala language specification](https://scala-lang.org/files/archive/spec/2.12/) describes Scala as:

> Scala is a Java-like programming language which unifies object-oriented and functional programming. It is a pure object-oriented language in the sense that every value is an object...
>
> Scala is a functional language in the sense that every function is a value...
>
> Scala has been designed to interoperate seamlessly with Java. Scala classes can call Java methods, create Java objects, inherit from Java classes and implement Java interfaces. None of this requires interface definitions or glue code.
