# What is Scala?

[Scala](https://scala-lang.org/) is a programming language created in 2001 by Martin Odersky and his research group at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/index.en.html) (École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne, Federal Polytechnic School of Lausanne), in Lausanne, Switzerland.

The [Scala language specification](https://scala-lang.org/files/archive/spec/2.12/) describes Scala as:

> Scala is a Java-like programming language which unifies object-oriented and functional programming. It is a pure object-oriented language in the sense that every value is an object...
>
> Scala is a functional language in the sense that every function is a value...
>
> Scala has been designed to interoperate seamlessly with Java. Scala classes can call Java methods, create Java objects, inherit from Java classes and implement Java interfaces. None of this requires interface definitions or glue code.

# What is the license of Scala?

[Scala is a project on GitHub.](https://github.com/scala/scala) The [license of Scala](https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/2.13.x/LICENSE) is a BSD (Berkeley System Distribution) 3-clause license.

# What are Scalamaris?

"Scalamaris" are Scala users. Probably "scalararis" is a pun on "calamari." (In Italian, "the squid" is "il calamaro," and "the squids" is "i calamari.")

# Who uses Scala?

[Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) is written in Scala. The web page for Spark describes Spark as:

> Apache Spark™ is a unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing.

David Lyon describes Scala and Spark in [A Newbie’s Guide to Scala and Why It’s Used for Distributed Computing](https://blog.insightdatascience.com/a-newbies-guide-to-scala-and-why-it-s-used-for-distributed-computing-979070a9f8).

See the answer wiki of the Quora question [What startups or tech companies are using Scala?](https://www.quora.com/What-startups-or-tech-companies-are-using-Scala)

# How can I learn Scala?

One way to learn Scala is to take the Coursera course [Functional Programming in Scala Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/scala), created by Martin Odersky, Heather Miller, Viktor Kuncak, and Aleksandar Prokopec.
