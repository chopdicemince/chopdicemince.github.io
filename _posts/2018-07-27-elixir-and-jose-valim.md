# What is Elixir? Who is José Valim?

[Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) is a programming language created in 2012 by José Valim, who is from Brazil and lives in Poland.

Valim programmed in [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), but he noticed that Ruby did not have good support for concurrency (for using multiple threads and multiple cores). Valim liked [Erlang](https://www.erlang.org/), but wanted to use ideas from other languages. So he created Elixir, which runs on the Erlang vritual machine. The home page for Elixir says:

> Elixir is a dynamic, functional language designed for building scalable and maintainable applications.
>
> Elixir leverages the Erlang VM, known for running low-latency, distributed and fault-tolerant systems, while also being successfully used in web development and the embedded software domain.

Valim co-founded [Plataformatec](http://plataformatec.com.br/), a software consulting company.
