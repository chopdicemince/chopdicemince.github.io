# Who is Harry Nyquist?

[Harry Nyquist](https://www.electronicdesign.com/digital-ics/harry-nyquist-founding-father-digital-communications) lived from 1889 to 1976. He was born in Sweden. He moved to the U.S., studied electrical engineering, and worked at AT&T (American Telephone & Telegraph).

# What is the "Nyquist rate" or "Nyquist frequency?"

In 1928, Nyquist published his most famous paper: [Certain Topics in Telegraph Transmission Theory](https://monoskop.org/images/2/2e/Nyquist_Harry_1928_Certain_Topics_in_Telegraph_Transmission_Theory.pdf). 

[Harry Nyquist: A Founding Father Of Digital Communications](https://www.electronicdesign.com/digital-ics/harry-nyquist-founding-father-digital-communications) describes the Nyquist Sampling Theorem as follows:

> According to the Sampling Theorem, an analog signal must be sampled at regular intervals over time and at twice the frequency of its highest-frequency component to be converted into an adequate representation of the signal in digital form. Thus, the "Nyquist frequency" is the highest frequency that can be accurately sampled. It represents one-half of the sampling frequency. Adhering to the Nyquist Sampling Theorem ensures no lost data upon reconstruction in the analog domain.

# What is a sparse signal?

A signal is __sparse__ if it has "very few" nonzero coefficients (when it is represented in some basis.)

Sparse approximations are used in the image format JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group), and in the video formats MPEG (Moving Picture Experts Group), which includes [MP3](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000012.shtml).
