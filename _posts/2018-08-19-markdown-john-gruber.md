# What is Markdown? Who is John Gruber?

Markdown is a programing language created in or before 2004 by John Gruber. The [web page of Markdown by John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) describes Markdown as:

> Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).
>
> Thus, “Markdown” is two things: (1) a plain text formatting syntax; and (2) a software tool, written in Perl, that converts the plain text formatting to HTML.

# Who uses Markdown?

If you decide to blog on GitHub, and if you use [Ruby Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), then you can write your posts in Markdown. (I do this.)

GitHub has its own version of Markdown. See [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

# What does Markdown look like?

[Matt Cone has a nice web page of examples in Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax). Matt Cone also wrote a free, downloadable book about Markdown, called [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/book).

# What is the file extension for Markdown?

Markdown file names end with: .md
