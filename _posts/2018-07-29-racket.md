# What is Racket?

[Racket](https://racket-lang.org/) is a programming language created in 1995 to explore language-oriented programming. The creators include Matthias Felleisen, Robert Bruce Findler, Matthew Flatt, Shriram Krishnamurthi, Eli Barzilay, Jay McCarthy, and Sam Tobin-Hochstadt. The creators describe Racket as "an heir to Lisp and Scheme."

For a history of Racket by some of the creators, see [A Programmable Programming Language](https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/3/225475-a-programmable-programming-language/fulltext).
