# What is Python pandas?

[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/index.html) is a Python module/library for data analysis, created in 2008 by [AQR](https://www.aqr.com/), an investing company.

In 2015, pandas started being managed and funded by [NumFOCUS](https://numfocus.org/), a charity in the United States.

The [documentation of pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/) describes pandas as:

> The two primary data structures of pandas, Series (1-dimensional) and DataFrame (2-dimensional), handle the vast majority of typical use cases in finance, statistics, social science, and many areas of engineering. For R users, DataFrame provides everything that R’s data.frame provides and much more.
>
> pandas is a dependency of [statsmodels](http://www.statsmodels.org/stable/) [another Python module/library], making it an important part of the statistical computing ecosystem in Python.
