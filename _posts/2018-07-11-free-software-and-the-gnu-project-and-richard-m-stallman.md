# What is free software?

"Free software" is a special phrase. A commom misconception is that the "free" in "free software" means "zero-cost," but the "free" really means "freedom." (Free software is often zero-cost, but it does not have to be.) Specifically, a program is free software if:

* You have the freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose.
* You have the freedom to modify the program to suit your needs. (To make this freedom effective in practice, you must have access to the source code, since making changes in a program without having the source code is exceedingly difficult.)
* You have the freedom to redistribute copies, either gratis or for a fee.
* You have the freedom to distribute modified versions of the program, so that the community can benefit from your improvements.

(The above four freedoms are verbatim from [The GNU Project](https://www.gnu.org/gnu/thegnuproject.en.html).)

It is an unfortunate quirk of English that the word "free" can mean both "zero-cost" and "freedom." Some other languages do not have this problem. For example, Spanish uses the phrase "software libre" for "free software," and "software gratis/gratuito" for "zero-cost software."

Sometimes people try to clarify the meaning of "free" in "free software," by saying something like, "'free' as in 'speech' [free speech], not as in 'beer' [free beer]."
