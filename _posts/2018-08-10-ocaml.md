# What is OCaml?

"OCaml" stands for "objective categorial machine language."

[OCaml](https://ocaml.org/) is a programming language created in 2011 or earlier by INRIA (institut national de recherche, National Institute of Research), in France.

The home page of OCaml describes OCaml as:

> OCaml is an industrial strength programming language supporting functional, imperative and object-oriented styles


OCaml is a dialect of the programming language "ML." which stands for "meta language."

Note: Be careful not to confuse OCaml with programming languges which have similar names, such as Caml and Caml Light, which are previous versions of OCaml. Also, Microsoft has the programming language [CAML](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/schema/introduction-to-collaborative-application-markup-language-caml) (Collaborative Application Markup Language).
