# What is Swift? Who is Chris Lattner?

[Swift](https://swift.org/) is a programming language created in 2010 by [Chris Lattner](http://www.nondot.org/sabre/), who worked at Apple. Apple released Swift in 2014.

The [Apple web page about Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) describes Swift as:

> Swift is a powerful and intuitive programming language for macOS, iOS, watchOS and tvOS.

Swift is a replacement for Objective C.

The logo of Swift is a drawing of a swift (the bird).

# What is the license of Swift?

[Swift is a project on GitHub.](https://github.com/apple/swift) The [license of Swift](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/LICENSE.txt) is the [Apache license, version 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html).

# What is LLVM?

[LLVM](https://llvm.org/) is a project about writing modular code for compilers for any language. LLVM was created by Chris Lattner when he was at the [University of Illinois](https://illinois.edu/). His adviser was [Vikram Adve](http://vikram.cs.illinois.edu/). See [Why Apple's Swift Language Will Instantly Remake Computer Programming](https://www.wired.com/2014/07/apple-swift/).

According to the LLVM home page, "LLVM" is not an initialism. However, you might see "LLVM" described as "low-level virtual machine."

# What is Clang?

"Clang" stands for "C language family frontend for LLVM." Clang is a project about writing code for LLVM to compile the C language family: C, C++, Objective C, Objective C++, NVIDIA [CUDA](https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/1.0/NVIDIA_CUDA_Programming_Guide_1.0.pdf) (Compute Unified Device Architecture), and [RenderScript](https://source.android.com/devices/architecture/vndk/renderscript). Clang was created by Chris Lattner.
