# What is Smalltalk?

Smalltalk is a programming language created in the 1970's at Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (Xerox PARC). [Alan Kay](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Alan-Kay) was one of the creators. One goal of Smalltalk was to be a programming language which young people could learn.

Smalltalk was one of the first object-oriented programming languages.

Steve Jobs was a co-founder of Apple. He visited Xerox PARC and saw a Smalltalk graphical user interface (GUI). Apple copied the GUI and created Macintosh GUI.
