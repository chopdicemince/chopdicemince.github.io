# What is Smalltalk?

Smalltalk is a programming language created in the 1970's at Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (Xerox PARC). [Alan Kay](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Alan-Kay) was one of the creators. One goal of Smalltalk was that young people could learn it.

Smalltalk was one of the first object-oriented programming languages.

Steve Jobs was a co-founder of Apple. He visited Xerox PARC and saw a Smalltalk graphical user interface (GUI). Apple copied the GUI and created the Macintosh GUI.

# What is Smalltalk-80?

# What is Squeak?

Smalltalk used to require expensive licenses and powerful computers. Consequently, Smalltalk was not widely used.

[Squeak](https://squeak.org/) is an implementation of Smalltalk by the original creators of Smalltalk. [Squeak uses two licenses: an MIT license, and the Apache license, version 2.0.](https://squeak.org/license/)

# What is Pharo?

[Pharo](https://pharo.org/web) is a version of Smalltalk that was created in 2008. [Pharo uses two licenses: an MIT license and an Apache license.](https://pharo.org/web/license)

# What is Amber?

[Amber](https://amber-lang.net/) is a version of Smalltalk created in or before 2011 by Nicolas Petton, based on [Amber copyright dates](https://github.com/amber-smalltalk/amber).

The home page of Amber describes Amber as:

> The Amber language is deeply inspired by Smalltalk. It is designed to make client-side development faster and easier...
>
> Amber is written in itself, including the compiler, and compiles into efficient JavaScript, mapping one-to-one with the JS equivalent...
>
> Smalltalk stands head and shoulders above most other languages for clarity, conciseness, and human-friendliness.
>
> As a language, it is immensely clean and mature, both syntactically and semantically. It is a pure OO language, with objects all the way down.

[The Amber website has an online, short, interactive tutorial.](https://amber-lang.net/learn.html)

# what is the license of Amber?

[Amber used to be a GitHub project](https://github.com/amber-smalltalk/amber), but [Amber is now a Gogs project](https://lolg.it/amber/amber). The [license of Amber](https://lolg.it/amber/amber/src/master/LICENSE) is an [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
