# What is Go?

[Go](https://golang.org/), also called Golang ("Go language"), is a programming language created on 2007-09-21 by Google. The creators are Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson.

The mascot of Go is a Gopher.

[Rob Pike described Go as follows:](https://talks.golang.org/2012/splash.article)

> Go is a compiled, concurrent, garbage-collected, statically typed language developed at Google.
>
> Go is a programming language designed by Google to help solve Google's problems, and Google has big problems.
>
> The goals of the Go project were to eliminate the slowness and clumsiness of software development at Google, and thereby to make the process more productive and scalable.

Pike described a problem of long compilation times at Google:

> The construction of a single C++ binary at Google can open and read hundreds of individual header files tens of thousands of times. In 2007, build engineers at Google instrumented the compilation of a major Google binary. The file contained about two thousand files that, if simply concatenated together, totaled 4.2 megabytes. By the time the #includes had been expanded, over 8 gigabytes were being delivered to the input of the compiler, a blow-up of 2000 bytes for every C++ source byte.
>
> That 2007 binary took 45 minutes using a precursor distributed build system;...
>
> The origin myth for Go states that it was during one of those 45 minute builds that Go was conceived.
