# What is ProtonMail?

[ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com/) is an email company in Geneva, Switzerland. ProtonMail was created by Andy Yen.

The name ProtonMail probably comes from the fact that some of its past or current workers also worked at [CERN](https://home.cern/) (Conseil Européen pour la Recherche Nucléaire---European Council for the Nuclear Research).

# What are some benefits of ProtonMail?

The web page of ProtonMail lists some benefits:

* ProtonMail is incorporated in Switzerland and all our servers are located in Switzerland. This means all user data is protected by strict Swiss privacy laws.

* All emails are secured automatically with end-to-end encryption. This means even we cannot decrypt and read your emails. As a result, your encrypted emails cannot be shared with third parties.

* No personal information is required to create your secure email account. By default, we do not keep any IP logs which can be linked to your anonymous email account. Your privacy comes first.

* We believe email privacy should be available to all. That's why our code is open source and basic ProtonMail accounts are always free. You can support the project by donating or upgrading to a paid account.

# How does ProtonMail make money?

[Proton mail has various account plans.](https://protonmail.com/signup) The basic account plan is zero-cost. Other account plans have a monthly cost, but if you pay for a whole year at once, you get a discount.

# How is ProtonMail related to Cambridge Analytica?

Around 2018-07-21, there was a news story about the company Cambridge Analytica, which maliciously collected data on 50 million Facebook users. Cambridge Analytica used a feature of ProtonMail which makes emails self-destruct after a certain time period. (This feature is available only for emails sent between two ProtonMail accounts.)
