See the New York Times article [At a Software Powerhouse, the Good Life Is Under Siege](https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/22/business/22sas.html), which describes SAS as:

> SAS’s specialty, a lucrative niche called business intelligence software...
>
> it was founded in 1976 by Mr. Goodnight and three colleagues from the agricultural statistics department at North Carolina State University. Its techniques were initially used to calculate the intricacies of soil, weather, seed varieties and other factors to improve crop yields...
>
> The SAS stronghold is a more sophisticated kind of software typically called “advanced analytics and predictive modeling,” 

# Is SAS a publicly traded company?

# What is SAS like as a workplace?

The above New York Times articles describes the SAS workplace as:

> There is the subsidized day care and preschool. There are the four company doctors and the dozen nurses who provide free primary care. The recreational amenities include basketball and racquetball courts, a swimming pool, exercise rooms and 40 miles of running and biking trails. There is a meditation garden, as well as on-site haircuts, manicures, and jewelry repair. Employees are encouraged to work 35-hour weeks...
>
> The day-care program began after a valued employee was about to leave to take care of her young child...
>
> ...SAS estimates that its health care center saves the company $5 million a year, by providing care more cheaply than an outside insurer and by not having employees leave the campus for doctor’s visits. Employee turnover at SAS averages 4 percent a year, versus about 20 percent for the overall software industry.
