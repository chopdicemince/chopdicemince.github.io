# What is Lisp? Who is John McCarthy?

"Lisp" stands for "List processing." Lisp is a programming language invented in 1958, by John McCarthy.

When McCarthy invented Lisp, he was an assistant professor of communications sciences (in electrical engineering) at MIT. At the same time, he started the MIT Artificial Intelligence Project.

For an autobiographical history of Lisp, see [History of Lisp (1979-02-12)](http://jmc.stanford.edu/articles/lisp/lisp.pdf).

# In Lisp, what do the functions "CAR" and "CDR" stand for?

"CAR" returns the initial element of a list. "CDR" returns a list, except for its initial element.

"CDR" is pronounced like "could-er."

The abbreviations "CAR" and "CDR" come from the fact that an early implementation of LISP was on a computer whose words had four parts: address, decrement, prefix, and tag. "CAR" stands for "Contents of the Address part of Register number." "CDR" has a similar definition---replace "Address" by "Decrement." See [History of Lisp (1979-02-12)](http://jmc.stanford.edu/articles/lisp/lisp.pdf).
