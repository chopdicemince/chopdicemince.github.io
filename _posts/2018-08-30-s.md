# What is S?

S is a programming langauge created in 1975 or 1976 at Bell Labs. S was created to do statistics.

See [A Brief History of S](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~cocteau/stat202a/resources/docs/shistory.pdf):

> S grew up in 1975-1976 in the statistics research departments at Bell Laboratories...
>
> It was the realization that routine data analysis should not require writing Fortran programs that really got S going...
>
> Our primary goal was to bring interactive computing to bear on statistics and data analysis problems. S was designed as an interactive language based entirely on functions...
>
> (We were all tired of Fortran’s seemingly capricious restrictions, on the form of subscripts, etc.)...

# Where did the name S come from?

See [A Brief History of S](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~cocteau/stat202a/resources/docs/shistory.pdf):

> By July, 1976, we decided to name the system. Acronyms were in abundance at Bell Laboratories, so it seemed sure that we would come up with one for our system, but no one seemed to be able to agree with any one else’s suggestion: Interactive SCS (ISCS), Statistical Computing System (too confusing), Statistical Analysis System (already taken), etc. In the end, we decided that all of these names contained an ‘S’ and, with the C programming language as a precedent, decided to name the system ‘S’. (We dropped the quotes by 1979).
