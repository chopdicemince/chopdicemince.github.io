# What is Objective-C?

Objective-C is a programming language created in the early 1980's by Brad Cox.

Objective-C adds a small set of features to C to make it object-oriented.

See [Introduction To Objective-C](https://www.cs.colorado.edu/~kena/classes/5448/f12/lectures/13-introtoobjectivec.pdf).

# Who uses Objective-C?

In 1985, Steve Jobs was fired from Apple, after a power struggle with CEO John Sculley. (In 1976, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak had founded Apple.) Later in 1985, Steve Jobs co-founded NeXT, a computer company, and Pixar Animation Studios.

In 1988, NeXT licensed Objective-C, using it to write its operating system, called NeXTSTEP.

In 1996, Apple bought NeXT. Apple turned NeXTSTEP into Mac OS X, which was released in 2000.

As of 2008, Objective-C was the main language for writing programs for iOS, for the iPhone and iPad.

# What is Objective-C used for?

At Apple, Objective-C is used for Cocoa, which is a set of two libraries:

1. The Foundation library has classes for "foundation" objects such as strings and arrays.

2. The AppKit library has classes for creating applications.

On iOS, AppKit is replaced by UIKit ("User Interface Kit"), and "Cocoa" is called "Cocoa touch."
